# Broker: Static binary

We use `musl` with the `jemalloc` allocator to build a static Linux binary.
Static binaries are not a goal for Broker for Windows or macOS environments.

## Why `musl`?

Rust, as we all know, links statically!

... Except that really only applies to _crates_. When we start talking about FFI,
Rust programs _can_ link with C FFI statically, or they can do it dynamically.

And what about the core runtime, like the allocator? By default, Rust programs
dynamically link to the system `libc`, like any C program would!

```
❯ cargo build --release
❯ ldd target/release/broker
  linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc763fe000)
        libbz2.so.1.0 => /usr/lib/libbz2.so.1.0 (0x00007effa5181000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007effa515c000)
        libm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007effa4313000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007effa4129000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007effa51a5000)
```

Usually this is fine, and even preferred. It lets system operators choose which
version of `libc` to use, and additionally reduces the size of the binary.
Unfortunately this can cause problems:

```
❯ docker run -it --rm roboxes/rhel8
❯ sudo docker cp target/release/broker 0fd8973ab69c:/root/broker
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# ln -s /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1 /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1.0
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# ./broker --version
./broker: /lib64/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by ./broker)
./broker: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by ./broker)
./broker: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by ./broker)
./broker: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.33' not found (required by ./broker)
./broker: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./broker)
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.28
```

If we build against `musl` instead, we can avoid this issue:

```
❯ cross build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features jemalloc --release
❯ ldd target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/broker
      statically linked
```

And now when we run it in a system with an older `libc`, it works:

```
❯ docker run -it --rm roboxes/rhel8
❯ sudo docker cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/broker 0fd8973ab69c:/root/broker
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# ./broker --version
broker 0.2.1
```

We also get static linking of our other dependencies for free,
no more need to mess around with e.g. `libbz2`:

```
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# rm /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1.0
rm: remove symbolic link '/usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1.0'? y
[root@0fd8973ab69c ~]# ./broker --version
broker 0.2.1
```

## Why `jemalloc`?

We created a benchmark to demonstrate the performance of a Rust
program using `musl`, under `benches/allocations.rs`. You can 
run it with `cargo bench`.

Benchmark system information:
```
❯ macchina -o kernel -o processor -o memory

```

### `libc` with native allocator

This is considered the baseline.

### `libc` with `jemalloc`

This is just for completion.

```

### `musl` with native allocator

This is wildly slower than the baseline; this is why we use `jemalloc`.

```
❯ cross bench --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

                        Performance has regressed.
```

### `musl` with `jemalloc`

Here we see that `musl`, even with `jemalloc`, has a performance penalty but it's no longer a _597%_ increase to runtime.
This is an acceptable tradeoff for static linux binaries.

```
❯ cross bench --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features jemalloc
