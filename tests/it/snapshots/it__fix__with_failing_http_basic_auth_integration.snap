"\nDiagnosing connections to configured repositories\n❌ https://github.com/fossas/broker.git\nDiagnosing connection to FOSSA\n✅ check fossa API connection with no auth required❌ check fossa API connection with auth required\nErrors found while checking integrations\n❌ https://github.com/fossas/broker.git\n\nBroker encountered an error while trying to connect to your git remote at 'https://github.com/fossas/broker.git'.\n\nBroker was unable to connect to this repository. Please make sure that the authentication info and the remote are set correctly in your config.yml file.\n\nYou are using HTTP basic authentication for this remote. This method of authentication encodes the username and password as a base64 string and then passes that to git using the \"http.extraHeader\" parameter. To debug this, please make sure that the following commands work.\n\nYou generate the base64 encoded username and password by joining them with a \":\" and then base64 encoding them. If your username was \"pat\" and your password was \"password123\", then you would base64 encode \"pat:password123\". For example, you can use a command like this:\n\necho -n \"<username>:<password>\" | base64\n\nOnce you have the base64 encoded username and password, use them in a command like this, replacing <REDACTED> with your base64 encoded string:\n\nGIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT='0' GCM_INTERACTIVE='never' GIT_ASKPASS='' git -c credential.helper= -c http.extraHeader=AUTHORIZATION: Basic <REDACTED> ls-remote --quiet https://github.com/fossas/broker.git\n\nFull error message from git:\n\nrun command: git\nargs: [\"-c\", \"credential.helper=\", \"-c\", \"http.extraHeader=AUTHORIZATION: Basic <REDACTED>\", \"ls-remote\", \"--quiet\", \"https://github.com/fossas/broker.git\"]\nenv: [\"GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT='0'\", \"GCM_INTERACTIVE='never'\", \"GIT_ASKPASS=<REMOVED>\"]\nstatus: 128\nstdout: ''\nstderr: 'fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled'\n\n\nErrors found while checking connection to FOSSA\n❌ Error checking connection to FOSSA: GET to fossa endpoint 'https://app.fossa.com/api/cli/organization' with authentication required\n\nBroker received an \"Unauthorized\" status response from FOSSA. This can mean that the fossa_integration_key configured in your config.yml file is not correct. You can obtain a FOSSA API key by going to Settings => Integrations => API in the FOSSA application.\n\nThe URL Broker attempted to connect to was 'https://app.fossa.com/api/cli/organization'. Please make sure you can make a request to that URL. For example, try this curl command:\n\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <your fossa api key>\" https://app.fossa.com/api/cli/organization\n\nFull error message: HTTP status client error (401 Unauthorized) for url (https://app.fossa.com/api/cli/organization)\n"
